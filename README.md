## 🔍 Project Overview

This application is designed to reduce the food waste problem. In this repository is a front-end application, back-end is located [here](https://github.com/HelloNatalia/licencjat-backend).

It's divided into several modules:

<br>

### Announcements 🤝

This is the ❤️ of the application. Here, users can create announcements offering products that would otherwise be thrown out. In announcements are information, among others, like what the product is, where it can be taken, what dates and times are the best for the announcement owner, and the expiration date. 
Announcements can be displayed on a map or as a list. It also contains different filters and search form to search by title and description.

<br>

### Requests 🔔

When a user is interested in any product, by being logged in he/she can send requests to pick it up. When creating a request, users must specify the pickup date and time to help the announcement owner make a decision. The owner can accept or decline the request, and once accepted, there is an option to mark the request as received.

Once the product from the announcement is received, both users can create **ratings** to indicate the reliability of the person.

<br>

### Recipes 🥗

This is another important feature of the application. Here users can choose which product they have and the application shows them recipes they can make. If recipes with missing products are shown, the information will show next to the missing ones in the recipe. The information is about available announcements for this product in the users’ area. So the two main functionalities are combined.

<br>

### Account 👩‍🌾

All users can register and log in. At the "account" site are all account information. There is a possibility to edit or delete an account. Here is also the place to create an address. Thanks to that while creating an announcement, the address can be typed in by only one click. Another advantage is that it displays the correct city next to the missing products in a recipe, as many users may be using VPNs to mask their real location.

<br>

### Managing panel 🛠

This panel is only for users with admin roles. There are functions like creating recipes, accepting users' recipes, managing users' reports, and managing application content: products list, product categories list, and recipe categories list.
