## 🔍 Project Overview

This front-end application is designed with the aim of reducing the problem of food waste. Back-end side is [here](https://github.com/HelloNatalia/licencjat-backend).

It is separated into few modules:

### Announcements 🤝

This is the ❤️ of the application. Here users can create announcements with products to give away which would otherwise be thrown out. In announcements are informations, amoung others, like what is the product, where it can be taken, what dates and times are the best for announcement owner and deadline of the product. 
Announcements can be shown on a map or in a list. It also contains different filters and search form to search by title and description.


### Requests 🔔

When user is interested in any product, by being logged-in he/she can send requests to pick it up. While creating request, user must insert the date and hour of pick up in order to make easier decision for announcement owner. Owner can accept or decline request. When request is accepted there is a button to check the request like received. 

When the product from announcement is received, both users can create **rating** in order to show other users if the person is reliable.

### Recipes 🥗

It is another important piece of application. Here users can choose which product they have and application shows then recipes that they can make. If recipes with missing products are shwon, next to the missing ones in recipe the information will show. The information is about available announcement with this product in user's area. So the two main functionalities are combined.

### Account 👩‍🌾

Every user can register and log in. At "account" site are all informations about account. There is possibility to edit or delet account. Here is also the place to create address. Thanks to that while for example creating announcement, the address can be typed in by only one click. Another advantage of this is showing right city next to the missing products in recipe, because many of the users can use for example VPN with changed real location.
